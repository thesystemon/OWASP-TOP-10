| -- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | 🧪 Tamper with software updates                  | Intercept `.exe`, `.deb`, `.rpm` updates using a proxy like Burp Suite or mitmproxy |

| 12 | 📂 Look for tampered `.env` or config files      | Check for altered credentials or logic toggles                                      |
| 13 | 💉 Inject malicious webhook in CI/CD             | Trigger callback to your attacker server                                            |
| 14 | 🔍 Analyze containers for unsigned layers        | Use `docker trust inspect` or `cosign` to check                                     |
| 15 | 🧪 Bypass signed update enforcement              | Replace signed with unsigned update & test validation                               |
| 16 | 🗃️ Fuzz package manager inputs                  | Try malformed dependency versions (`1.0.0;;;;`)                                     |
| 17 | ⚠️ Abuse of open plugin ecosystems               | Upload backdoored plugins (e.g., Jenkins, WordPress, VSCode)                        |
| 18 | 📉 Rollback attack on version control            | Replace safe versions with old vulnerable ones                                      |
| 19 | 👨‍💻 Add unauthorized contributors              | Modify `.github/CODEOWNERS` or pipeline access                                      |
| 20 | 📤 Modify installer scripts with logic bombs     | Trigger payload on install or update (e.g., `pip install`)                          |

### 🔥 **Software and Data Integrity Failures – Offensive Security Checklist (21–40)**

21. 🔍 **Tamper with software update URLs**
    ➤ Modify or redirect update URLs via DNS poisoning or proxy interception to serve malicious packages.

22. 🛠️ **Inject into CI/CD pipeline**
    ➤ Modify build scripts, plugins, or dependencies in CI/CD to introduce malicious logic (e.g., via `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `.github/workflows`).

23. 🧩 **Test for unsigned container images**
    ➤ Pull and verify images from registries; lack of signing validation can allow tampered images.

24. 🧪 **Upload malicious `.jar`/`.war` to software repositories**
    ➤ Abuse insecure upload mechanisms to introduce backdoored artifacts.

25. 🧵 **Check if third-party libraries are loaded via HTTP**
    ➤ Look for external scripts/libraries (JS, CSS, etc.) loaded over HTTP instead of HTTPS.

26. 🧬 **Exploit dependency confusion in private package managers**
    ➤ Publish same-name packages in public repositories (npm, PyPI) to be pulled before private ones.

27. 🛠️ **Reverse engineer desktop apps for embedded secrets**
    ➤ Check `.exe`, `.apk`, or `.jar` files for hardcoded tokens, URLs, or insecure update logic.

28. 🕷️ **Tamper with integrity check logic (e.g., checksums)**
    ➤ Bypass or alter `sha256sum`, `md5`, or hash checks performed before execution of downloaded packages.

29. 🧪 **Check software repos for malicious commits or hidden backdoors**
    ➤ Analyze recent changes in software source control (GitHub, GitLab) for suspicious activity.

30. 🔧 **Audit Helm charts, Terraform, Dockerfiles for integrity gaps**
    ➤ Identify references to mutable or latest tags without content trust or digests.

31. 🧬 **Test self-hosted services for package verification bypass**
    ➤ Abuse local mirrors or artifact servers to distribute manipulated components.

32. 🧾 **Check cron jobs or scheduled tasks for unsigned scripts**
    ➤ Scripts executed on schedule might be modifiable and unsigned — prime for persistence.

33. 🕳️ **Inject payloads into .deb/.rpm packages during testing**
    ➤ If CI builds Debian or RedHat packages, test if malicious pre/post scripts can run silently.

34. 🔌 **Interfere with plugin loading mechanisms**
    ➤ Modify plugin directories or inject malicious shared libraries to be auto-loaded by the app.

35. 🔗 **Analyze manifest/configuration drift in IaC**
    ➤ Compare desired vs. actual state in environments; drift may introduce insecure versions or modules.

36. 📦 **Use signed malware mimicking a legitimate app**
    ➤ Sign and test execution paths for trojanized binaries with valid certs if client-side trust is loose.

37. 🧱 **Bypass CSP/Integrity Headers for JavaScript Injection**
    ➤ Check whether missing or weak `script-src` or `integrity` tags allow external JS injection.

38. 🧰 **Modify pre-installed SDKs or developer tools in test environments**
    ➤ Toolchains themselves (IDEs, debuggers) could carry manipulated modules or defaults.

39. 🧪 **Attempt package lockfile manipulation**
    ➤ Alter `package-lock.json`, `Pipfile.lock`, or similar to pull a different version than intended.

40. 🧨 **Abuse software rollbacks to reintroduce older, vulnerable versions**
    ➤ Trigger downgrade mechanisms to install previously patched versions.
