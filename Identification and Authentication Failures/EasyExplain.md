# 🔐 OWASP: Identification and Authentication Failures (Full Deep Explanation)

---

## ✅ 1. **What is it?**

> Authentication = Verifying *who* the user is.
> Identification = Recognizing *which* user is trying to log in.

**Failures occur when:**

* Credentials can be easily guessed or bypassed.
* Sessions aren't securely managed.
* MFA is missing or misconfigured.
* User identity can be spoofed or manipulated.

---

## 💣 **Why It's Dangerous**

* **Account takeovers**
* **Privilege escalation**
* **Bypassing business logic** (e.g., login limits)
* Full **admin access with weak password**

---

## 🚨 Real-World Examples of Exploits

---

### ✅ Example 1: Brute Force Login (No Rate Limiting)

**Vulnerable Endpoint:**

```http
POST /login
{ "username": "admin", "password": "123456" }
```

**What's wrong?**

* No rate limiting.
* Common usernames allowed.
* No CAPTCHA.

**Exploit:**

```bash
for password in passwordlist.txt; do
  curl -X POST https://target.com/login -d "username=admin&password=$password"
done
```

✅ **Fix:**

* Rate limit per IP and user.
* Lock accounts on repeated failures.
* Use CAPTCHA on failures.

---

### ✅ Example 2: Weak Password Policy

**What's wrong?**

* Allows passwords like `1234`, `admin`, `password`.

**Exploit:**

* Easy to guess for attackers.
* Account takeover in seconds.

✅ **Fix:**

* Enforce strong password policies:

  * Min 12 characters
  * At least 1 upper, 1 number, 1 symbol
  * Disallow common passwords

---

### ✅ Example 3: Session Fixation

**What's wrong?**

* Session ID does **not change after login**.

**Exploit:**

1. Attacker sends victim a link with a session ID.
2. Victim logs in, attacker hijacks session.

✅ **Fix:**

* Invalidate old session after login.
* Create a **new session ID** post-login.

---

### ✅ Example 4: Missing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**What's wrong?**

* High-privilege users can login with just username/password.

**Exploit:**

* Credential stuffing, reused passwords, leaked creds.

✅ **Fix:**

* Enforce MFA for:

  * Admin users
  * Sensitive workflows (e.g., money transfer)

---

### ✅ Example 5: User Enumeration

**Login responses differ:**

```plaintext
If user exists: "Incorrect password"
If user doesn't exist: "User not found"
```

**Exploit:**

* Attacker guesses valid usernames for brute-force attacks.

✅ **Fix:**

* Use generic error:

  > “Invalid username or password.”

---

### ✅ Example 6: Insecure "Remember Me" Tokens

**What's wrong?**

* "Remember me" token is static and reused.
* Not tied to device/IP or expiration.

**Exploit:**

* If token leaked → full access to account.

✅ **Fix:**

* Use short-lived, encrypted, device-bound tokens.
* Rotate tokens on every use.

---

### ✅ Example 7: No Logout or Expired Session

**What's wrong?**

* No session timeout.
* Users stay logged in forever.

**Exploit:**

* Public/shared device compromise.

✅ **Fix:**

* Timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity.
* Expire sessions after max 12–24 hours.
* Provide logout button that destroys session on server.

---

### ✅ Example 8: Broken JWT Validation

**What's wrong?**

* Server accepts unsigned JWTs or uses `alg: none`.

**Exploit:**

```json
{
  "alg": "none",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

* Attacker forges token and bypasses authentication.

✅ **Fix:**

* Always validate signature using strong HMAC or RSA.
* Never allow `alg: none`.

---

### ✅ Example 9: Missing Account Lockout

**What's wrong?**

* Login allows unlimited tries on an account.

**Exploit:**

* Brute-force attacks, credential stuffing.

✅ **Fix:**

* Lock account temporarily after 5 failed attempts.
* Notify users of suspicious login attempts.

---

### ✅ Example 10: Password Reset Abuse

**What's wrong?**

* Predictable or reusable password reset tokens.
* No expiration.

**Exploit:**

* Attacker guesses/reset tokens.

✅ **Fix:**

* Token must:

  * Be random (UUID or cryptographically secure)
  * Expire after 10–15 minutes
  * Be tied to session/email/IP

## 🧰 Prevention Checklist (Deep with Checkboxes)

| ☐     | Sessions must expire after idle and absolute timeout                |   |
| ☐     | Logout must destroy session on server                               |   |
