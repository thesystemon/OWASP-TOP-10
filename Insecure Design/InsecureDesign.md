# üîê **Chapter 1: Insecure Design (Deep)**

**OWASP Top 10 - A04:2021**

---

## üîé **Definition**

Insecure Design refers to flaws in application architecture and logic that lead to security weaknesses. These are not implementation bugs but rather issues stemming from missing or ineffective security controls that were never designed into the system.

> üí° *It‚Äôs a proactive risk‚Äîreflecting an absence of secure thinking rather than the presence of broken code.*

---

## üìö **Real-World Example**

* A password reset functionality that allows unlimited token generation and guessing.
* A financial app that lets users manipulate `accountID` in the request to view others‚Äô balance due to poor design of access logic.
* An e-commerce site that lacks rate limiting for checkout functionality, allowing purchase abuse.

---

## üß† **Key Characteristics**

| ‚úÖ Designed with Security          | ‚ùå Insecure Design                     |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Input validation at design time   | Relying on post-validation or WAFs    |
| Defined trust boundaries          | No defined data flow or trust mapping |
| Abuse case handling               | Ignoring potential misuse scenarios   |
| Least privilege design            | Users get more access than needed     |

### **Chapter 2: Types of Insecure Design (Deep Dive)**

Insecure design stems from flawed decisions during the architecture and planning phase of software development. This chapter explores the major types of insecure design vulnerabilities with explanations, real-world cases, and how they manifest in applications.

---

#### üîπ 1. **Missing or Ineffective Access Controls**

**Description:**
Failure to define proper access control requirements during design allows unauthorized actions.

**Examples:**

* A banking app allows users to access admin dashboards via predictable URLs.
* APIs lack role-based restrictions allowing normal users to perform admin-level actions.

**Attack Surface:**

* APIs
* Internal admin portals
* URL parameters and headers

**Common Mistakes:**

* No design for least privilege
* Access checks done only at the UI level, not backend

---

#### üîπ 2. **Lack of Threat Modeling**

**Description:**
Developers design systems without identifying possible threats, attackers, or abuse scenarios.

**Examples:**

* Chat application does not anticipate DDoS attacks from automated bots.
* Payment system does not validate transaction origin.

**Attack Surface:**

* Endpoints and interfaces
* Payment gateways
* Third-party integration points

**Symptoms:**

* Poor abuse case consideration
* No defense in depth

---

#### üîπ 3. **Improper Segmentation**

**Description:**
Designs that fail to isolate resources, data, or users lead to privilege escalation or lateral movement.

**Examples:**

* Multi-tenant SaaS platforms storing customer data in the same database without isolation.
* Internal services exposed to the public network.

**Attack Surface:**

* Shared databases
* Monolithic backends
* Microservices with poor API gateway design

**Consequences:**

* Tenant data leaks
* Full system compromise if one module is breached

---

#### üîπ 4. **Trusting the Client**

**Description:**
Designs assume the client (browser, mobile app) will behave as expected and not be tampered with.

**Examples:**

* Relying on hidden form fields for user roles
* Allowing the frontend to control pricing in an e-commerce system

**Attack Surface:**

* Web/mobile frontend ‚Üí backend
* Browser dev tools
* API calls

**Exploitation Impact:**

* Price manipulation
* Unauthorized data access

---

#### üîπ 5. **Insecure Defaults**

**Description:**
Designs that default to insecure settings create easy paths for attackers.

**Examples:**

* Newly created users have admin privileges by default
* Publicly exposed APIs by default on cloud deployments

**Attack Surface:**

* Cloud configurations (S3, EC2)
* User role assignments
* Firewall and security group settings

---

#### üîπ 6. **Lack of Secure Design Patterns**

**Description:**
Teams reinvent solutions instead of following proven security design patterns.

**Examples:**

* Custom encryption mechanisms instead of TLS
* DIY session/token mechanisms

**Attack Surface:**

* Authentication
* Encryption
* Session handling

**Fix:**
Use secure design libraries and frameworks (e.g., Spring Security, OAuth2 libraries)

---

#### üîπ 7. **No Rate Limiting or Abuse Protection**

**Description:**
Applications are not designed to handle abuse like brute-force, scraping, or enumeration.

**Examples:**

* Login page without rate limiting
* Password reset feature vulnerable to email harvesting

**Attack Surface:**

* Authentication forms
* APIs
* Forgot-password endpoints

**Tools for Testing:**

* Burp Suite Intruder
* OWASP ZAP
* ffuf/gobuster

---

#### üîπ 8. **Broken Secure Workflow Logic**

**Description:**
Logical security flaws in business flows due to poor design.

**Examples:**

* Allowing users to change roles via request manipulation
* Allowing financial transactions without authentication step

**Attack Surface:**

* Business logic
* API transactions
* Multi-step workflows

**Testing Tip:**
Map and break secure workflows; use fuzzing for states.

---

#### üîπ 9. **No Audit Logging Design**

**Description:**
No or poor planning for audit trails, forensic investigation, or monitoring.

**Examples:**

* No logs for sensitive user actions
* Logs that can be tampered by users

**Risk:**
Post-attack investigation becomes impossible.

**Secure Design Practice:**

* Immutable logging
* Centralized log collection (e.g., ELK, Splunk)

---

#### üîπ 10. **Flawed Account Lifecycle Handling**

**Description:**
Poorly designed flows for registration, password resets, account deletion, and reactivation.

**Examples:**

* Users can reuse previously deleted usernames
* Reset links don‚Äôt expire or are easily guessed

**Impact:**

* Account takeover
* Privilege escalation

---

### üîê Secure Design Principle Summary:

| Principle              | Description                                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Least Privilege        | Users/processes should only get what‚Äôs needed |
| Fail Secure            | If system fails, it must do so securely       |
| Defense in Depth       | Multiple security layers                      |
| Don't Trust the Client | Always validate inputs at server              |
| Secure Defaults        | Always ship with hardened settings            |

---

## **Chapter 3: Real-World Scenarios (Insecure Design)**

Understanding **real-world incidents** caused by insecure design allows professionals to relate theoretical weaknesses to practical outcomes. Below are various high-impact case studies where insecure design decisions led to serious security failures.

---

### **3.1 Case Study: Twitter Rate Limiting Failure (2023)**

* **Overview:**
  A bug in Twitter's API rate limiting allowed malicious actors to enumerate Twitter user handles associated with phone numbers and email addresses.

* **Design Flaw:**
  The API lacked **sufficient throttling and abuse detection** mechanisms, which is a classic insecure design issue. The system was **functional** but not secure by design.

* **Impact:**
  Over **5.4 million users** had their data scraped, including celebrities and politicians.

* **Takeaway:**
  Security should be integrated into **API design** with appropriate rate limiting, logging, and abuse detection‚Äînot as an afterthought.

---

### **3.2 Case Study: Uber‚Äôs Microservices Authorization Flaw**

* **Overview:**
  In 2019, Uber faced a vulnerability where insecure design in **microservice communication** led to privilege escalation.

* **Design Flaw:**
  Uber relied on the assumption that internal services were trusted. They failed to apply proper **zero-trust principles** and **authorization checks** at each layer.

* **Impact:**
  Attackers could impersonate drivers or riders by chaining microservices, resulting in **account takeovers** and manipulation of transactions.

* **Takeaway:**
  Designing secure microservices requires **authentication and authorization at every point**, not only at the gateway.

---

### **3.3 Case Study: Microsoft Teams GIF Bug (2020)**

* **Overview:**
  CyberArk researchers exploited a flaw where sending a malicious GIF could give attackers access to Teams accounts across an organization.

* **Design Flaw:**
  The architecture trusted **authenticated tokens** passed via images without **re-validating the request context**.

* **Impact:**
  This could lead to complete compromise of **Teams environments** in enterprises.

* **Takeaway:**
  Design must **not assume context** and should isolate input handling mechanisms, especially with rich media.

---

### **3.4 Case Study: Facebook Messenger Private Key Retention**

* **Overview:**
  Facebook‚Äôs earlier designs retained **encryption keys on the server-side** for Messenger ‚Äúsecret‚Äù conversations.

* **Design Flaw:**
  Although data was encrypted in transit and storage, key management design left room for **insider access** or government subpoena bypass.

* **Impact:**
  Conversations that users assumed were ‚Äúsecret‚Äù were **not end-to-end encrypted** as expected.

* **Takeaway:**
  Always design for **clear security expectations**‚Äîif the user expects end-to-end encryption, architecture must enforce it.

---

### **3.5 Case Study: Health App Data Exposure**

* **Overview:**
  A popular fitness app stored sensitive health metrics and user location without applying **data classification or access control mechanisms** in its design.

* **Design Flaw:**
  APIs returned too much data even to unauthenticated users. There was no **data minimization** or **risk-based access control** in the backend design.

* **Impact:**
  Personal health data was publicly accessible, leading to GDPR violations and reputational damage.

* **Takeaway:**
  Systems that handle **PII or sensitive health information** must embed **security and privacy principles at design time**.

---

### **3.6 Case Study: Tesla Keyless Entry Relay Attack**

* **Overview:**
  Tesla's design of keyless entry allowed attackers to **relay key fob signals** from a distance using inexpensive radio equipment.

* **Design Flaw:**
  The system didn‚Äôt incorporate **proximity verification** or signal integrity checks in the design phase.

* **Impact:**
  Cars were stolen without force or tampering.

* **Takeaway:**
  Design for **real-world threat models**‚Äîconvenience features must not compromise security expectations.

---

### **Summary of Design Flaws**

| Case Study         | Design Issue                     | Consequence           |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Twitter API        | Lack of abuse control            | Massive data scraping |
| Uber               | No zero-trust in microservices   | Privilege escalation  |
| Microsoft Teams    | Token trust without revalidation | Account takeover      |
| Facebook Messenger | Server-stored encryption keys    | Privacy failure       |
| Health App         | No access controls               | PII exposure          |
| Tesla              | Weak signal design               | Car theft             |

---

### **Key Design Lessons**

* Always integrate **security-by-design** practices.
* Use **zero-trust** and **least privilege** principles from the start.
* Anticipate **real-world attack vectors**, not just theoretical ones.
* Perform **design reviews and threat modeling** regularly.

---

## **Chapter 4: Testing Techniques (Insecure Design)**

Identifying insecure design flaws requires a different approach from traditional security testing methods like automated vulnerability scanners. It demands **manual inspection**, **threat modeling**, **abuse-case testing**, and understanding **business logic flaws** that arise due to poor or missing security design decisions. Here's a deep-dive into various testing techniques specifically tailored to uncover insecure design vulnerabilities:

---

### üîç 1. Threat Modeling

**Definition:**
Threat modeling is a structured approach to identify, quantify, and address the security risks associated with a system design.

**Techniques & Steps:**

* **Identify assets** (e.g., user data, payment information, APIs)
* **Create an architecture diagram** (include data flows, trust boundaries)
* **Enumerate threats** using models like **STRIDE**:

  * *Spoofing*, *Tampering*, *Repudiation*, *Information Disclosure*, *Denial of Service*, *Elevation of Privilege*
* **Prioritize threats** using risk scoring (e.g., DREAD or OWASP Risk Rating)
* **Mitigate threats** through design improvements before implementation.

**Tools:**

* Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool
* OWASP Threat Dragon
* IriusRisk

---

### üß™ 2. Abuse Case Testing

**Definition:**
Abuse-case testing involves thinking like an attacker and exploring how features can be misused rather than used as intended.

**Steps:**

* Analyze each user story or feature.
* Create **abuse stories** instead of **use cases** (e.g., *As an attacker, I want to bypass payment validation*).
* Test the application by attempting these abuse scenarios.

**Example:**
If a feature is meant to let users reset their passwords, an abuse case might be: *‚ÄúWhat happens if someone tries to brute-force the password reset token?‚Äù*

---

### üîß 3. Manual Code Review (Secure Design Perspective)

While source code reviews often focus on security bugs (e.g., buffer overflows, SQLi), for insecure design you look for:

* Missing or weak **authorization logic**
* Lack of **rate limiting** and **abuse prevention**
* Overly **permissive workflows**
* Lack of **encryption enforcement**
* Use of **custom authentication/authorization mechanisms**

**What to Look For:**

* Business logic not covered by access controls
* Inconsistent session management
* Authorization bypass in APIs
* Feature toggle misuse

**Tools for assisted review:**

* CodeQL
* SonarQube (with business logic plugins)
* GitHub Advanced Security

---

### üõ†Ô∏è 4. Design Review Checklists

OWASP provides checklists tailored for secure design. Sample checklist items include:

* Are all user inputs validated at all entry points?
* Are sensitive operations protected with authentication and authorization?
* Are session states protected from tampering?
* Does the application enforce least privilege?

**Tip:** Use design walkthroughs with both developers and security architects.

---

### üîé 5. Architecture Analysis

This involves looking at how different system components interact and evaluating:

* Trust boundaries between components (e.g., front-end, API, DB)
* Use of secure-by-default frameworks and libraries
* Placement of security controls (firewalls, WAF, authentication gateways)

**Common Pitfalls Identified:**

* Direct client-to-database communication
* No API gateway enforcing access control
* All logic handled in front-end JavaScript

---

### üîç 6. Business Logic Testing

This focuses on misuse of intended application behavior:

* Can the order of API calls be manipulated?
* Are workflows enforcing correct business logic paths?
* Can a user cancel a payment but still receive services?

**Examples:**

* Submitting discount codes multiple times due to lack of state enforcement
* Changing prices in client-side JavaScript for e-commerce sites
* Accessing premium content by manipulating subscription validation flows

---

### üß™ 7. Static & Dynamic Analysis (With Limitations)

Automated scanners like SAST and DAST have limited ability to detect insecure design.

* SAST (Static Application Security Testing): Good for locating missing input validation, but limited in detecting flawed logic.
* DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing): Can uncover logic flaws if the test scenarios are well-designed, but lacks context.

**Better Use Case:**
Use these as **supporting tools**, not primary ones for insecure design detection.

---

### üß™ 8. Fuzzing for Business Logic Bugs

Fuzzing tools like **Burp Intruder**, **ffuf**, or **custom scripts** can be configured for:

* Bypassing sequence enforcement (e.g., skipping verification step in KYC)
* Sending malformed JSON to break poorly validated workflows
* Brute-forcing logic-dependent tokens

---

### üîê 9. Context-Aware Penetration Testing

Hire skilled testers who understand:

* Business domain
* Application workflows
* Real-world abuse patterns

This is essential, especially for complex systems like banking, healthcare, or e-commerce.

---

### ‚úÖ 10. Red Team & Purple Team Exercises

* **Red Team:** Simulate real-world attackers to probe design-level weaknesses.
* **Purple Team:** Collaborate with defenders to analyze design impact and visibility.

## üî• Chapter 5: Exploitation Vectors (Insecure Design)

Exploitation of **Insecure Design** vulnerabilities doesn't rely on traditional bugs like buffer overflows or misconfigurations. Instead, they arise from **poor architectural choices**, **missing security controls**, or **lack of threat modeling**‚Äîbefore the first line of code is even written.

### üéØ Objective:

To understand how attackers exploit flawed system designs, identify weak points, and illustrate common attack paths that stem from insecure architecture or planning mistakes.

---

### üß† 5.1 Common Exploitation Vectors

#### 1. **Lack of Threat Modeling**

* **What Happens**: Developers never analyzed how attackers might abuse features.
* **Example**: An e-commerce checkout system doesn‚Äôt account for users altering the `price` parameter of an item via client-side manipulation.

#### 2. **Missing Authorization Logic**

* **What Happens**: Users can access data or actions without being verified.
* **Example**: A banking app allows users to guess or manipulate `user_id` in the URL to access another user's transaction history.

#### 3. **Overly Permissive Functionality**

* **What Happens**: The system offers too much flexibility.
* **Example**: A document generator allows uploading templates with embedded scripting (like macros or JS), allowing attackers to insert malicious payloads.

#### 4. **Unbounded Input**

* **What Happens**: No validation or limitations on user input leads to design abuse.
* **Example**: A notes app that allows excessively long text entries causing memory exhaustion or DoS.

#### 5. **Insecure Default Settings**

* **What Happens**: Features are enabled by default without proper configuration.
* **Example**: Admin panels accessible on `/admin` without being disabled in production.

#### 6. **Broken Workflow/State Logic**

* **What Happens**: Assumptions about step-by-step processes are flawed.
* **Example**: A user is allowed to skip payment but still receives a ‚ÄúSuccess‚Äù confirmation due to broken session or step management.

#### 7. **Business Logic Flaws**

* **What Happens**: Developers implement business rules in a way that users can game the system.
* **Example**: Coupons can be applied multiple times or reused due to poor backend validation.

#### 8. **Lack of Rate Limiting**

* **What Happens**: No limits on how often a user can perform a function.
* **Example**: An attacker performs brute force login attempts or password reset token guesses without restriction.

---

### üí£ 5.2 Real-World Exploitation Scenarios

#### üîì Scenario 1: Race Condition in Wallet Transfers

* **App Type**: Crypto wallet app.
* **Design Flaw**: The system doesn't lock balance updates between requests.
* **Attack**: User initiates multiple fund transfers simultaneously, bypassing balance checks.
* **Impact**: Double-spending / money duplication.

#### üîê Scenario 2: Insecure Multi-Step Processes

* **App Type**: Insurance Claim Portal
* **Design Flaw**: Each form step has independent state storage in cookies.
* **Attack**: User skips required photo verification step by directly accessing final submission URL.
* **Impact**: Fraudulent claims.

#### üõí Scenario 3: Improper Discount Application

* **App Type**: Shopping platform
* **Design Flaw**: Coupons are validated client-side.
* **Attack**: Modify local JS or HTTP request to apply a coupon multiple times.
* **Impact**: Severe revenue loss.

| **Custom Scripts**               | Automate abuse of logic flaws (Python, Bash) |

---

### üîÅ 5.4 Exploitation Techniques

| Technique                 | Description                               | Example                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Parameter Tampering**   | Alter request parameters to bypass logic  | Change `user_role=guest` to `admin`     |
| **Forced Browsing**       | Access restricted pages or steps directly | Skip payment and go to `/order/success` |
| **Concurrency Attacks**   | Send multiple requests in parallel        | Bypass wallet balance                   |
| **State Bypass**          | Manipulate cookies/session to jump steps  | Skip OTP verification                   |
| **Workflow Manipulation** | Reorder intended steps                    | Claim refund before item is delivered   |

---

### üßØ 5.5 Impact Severity

| Impact      | Description                                                                |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üü• Critical | Full compromise of business logic (e.g., unauthorized access, money fraud) |
| üüß High     | Process bypasses, repeated abuse (e.g., DoS, double-spending)              |
| üü® Medium   | Partial logic flaws, privilege escalations                                 |
| üü© Low      | Non-critical bypasses with limited scope                                   |

---

### üß™ 5.6 Red Team Perspective

Red teams often target insecure design elements not easily flagged by scanners. They:

* Look for inconsistencies in user roles, state changes, and transitions.
* Create custom exploit chains combining flaws (e.g., insecure redirects + open endpoints).
* Monitor server responses to out-of-sequence or malformed inputs.

---

### ‚úÖ Chapter 6: Prevention Techniques for Insecure Design (Deep)

---

Design flaws are often the root cause of security vulnerabilities, especially in complex systems. Preventing insecure design requires proactive, architecture-level thinking, secure development lifecycle (SDL) integration, and enforcing security-by-design principles throughout development. Here‚Äôs an in-depth look at how to prevent insecure design effectively:

---

### üîê 6.1 Secure Design Principles (Foundational)

These principles form the foundation of designing secure systems:

| Principle                   | Description                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Least Privilege**         | Each component or user should have the minimum level of access or permissions needed to perform their function.       |
| **Defense in Depth**        | Layer multiple security controls to protect against failure of one layer.                                             |
| **Fail Securely**           | Applications should fail in a secure manner, avoiding the exposure of sensitive information during crashes or errors. |
| **Minimize Attack Surface** | Reduce entry points and unnecessary features or services that could be abused.                                        |
| **Secure Defaults**         | Default configurations should be secure out-of-the-box.                                                               |

### üß± 6.2 Secure Architecture Patterns

Adopting secure architectural models can eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities:

#### 1. **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Security**

* Ensures logical separation of UI, business logic, and data access.
* Prevents direct object references or broken access patterns.

#### 2. **Zero Trust Architecture**

* No implicit trust between network segments.
* Continuous verification of identity and context for access decisions.

#### 3. **Service-Oriented Secure Design (API Gateway, Microservices)**

* Use of API gateways to enforce authentication and rate limiting.
* Isolating services to reduce lateral movement in case of compromise.

#### 4. **Secure Data Flow Design**

* All data flows should be modeled, validated, and encrypted.
* Avoid trust boundaries being crossed unknowingly.

---

### üõ† 6.3 Developer-Centric Preventive Measures

#### ‚úÖ 1. **Threat Modeling**

* Perform early in the design phase (e.g., STRIDE, DREAD, PASTA).
* Identify potential misuse/abuse cases and mitigate them before code is written.

#### ‚úÖ 2. **Security Requirements Definition**

* Security should be part of functional requirements.
* Define how each feature handles authentication, authorization, logging, etc.

#### ‚úÖ 3. **Secure Coding Training**

* Equip developers with awareness of design flaws and patterns like:

  * Hardcoded secrets
  * Over-trust in client input
  * Absence of authorization layers

#### ‚úÖ 4. **Design Peer Reviews**

* Peer review architectural diagrams, threat models, and logic flows.
* Use checklists aligned with OWASP principles.
