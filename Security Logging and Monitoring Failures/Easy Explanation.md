# 🔥 **OWASP: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**

🎯 **Offensive Security Checklist** (Attack-Focused – Real-World Exploitation)

> Security Logging & Monitoring Failures happen when logs are missing, incomplete, poorly protected, or ignored — giving attackers the freedom to act stealthily without detection.

---

## ✅ What Is Security Logging and Monitoring Failure?

It refers to situations where:

* Important security events are **not logged**
* Logs are **incomplete or tampered with**
* Monitoring is absent or too weak to trigger alerts
* Attackers exploit the lack of monitoring to operate undetected

---

## 💣 Why It’s Dangerous

* Attackers can move laterally without triggering alarms
* Credentials can be exfiltrated unnoticed
* Persistent backdoors can be maintained indefinitely
* Post-incident forensics becomes impossible
* Data breaches can go undiscovered for months or years

## 🚨 Real-World Scenarios Where Monitoring Fails Helped Attackers

| 🔥 Incident                           | Description                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🎯 **Capital One Breach**             | Weak logging and monitoring allowed unauthorized access to AWS metadata and exfiltration of data |
| 🎯 **Equifax Data Leak**              | Lack of adequate monitoring delayed discovery for months                                         |
| 🎯 **SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack** | Sophisticated attackers evaded detection by manipulating logs and monitoring signals             |
| 🎯 **Target Retail Hack**             | Poor network segmentation and lack of log correlation allowed attackers to persist               |
| 🎯 **Jenkins RCE Incident**           | Logs did not capture misuse of API tokens, enabling attackers to run remote scripts undetected   |

## 🧠 Hacker Mindset – Log and Monitoring Failures

* ✅ **Look for writable logs** – attackers can erase traces
* ✅ **Test missing events** – not all requests are tracked
* ✅ **Slow attacks bypass alerts** – patience is your weapon
* ✅ **Multi-stage attacks evade correlation** – chain small steps
* ✅ **Debug info leaks secrets** – error pages are a goldmine
